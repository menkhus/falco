NAME
falco - 3rd party code security intelligence for software maintainers

SYNOPSIS

falco    [-h] [-b] [-c] [-C [CVE]] [-d [VFEED_DATABASE]]
      [-f [PACKAGELISTFILE]] [-i [ITEMS_REPORTED]] [-n [PACKAGE_NAME]]
      [-o [OUTPUTFILE]] [-t [TYPE]] [-u] [-v [PACKAGE_VERSION]] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
Checks via command line arguments or, a file list of software programs for known security defects documented in the National Vulnerability Database. Matches these 3rd party code project names and version names to CPE URIs in 
the NVD database.

OPTIONS  
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit  
  -b, --build_environment  for use in build environments, return fail if items found  
  -c  setup database for use after the database has been updated  
  -C [CVE], --CVE [CVE]  display a CVE entry
  -d [VFEED_DATABASE], --vfeed_database [VFEED_DATABASE]  location of toolswatch/vfeed.db sqlite database  
  -f [PACKAGELISTFILE], --packagelistfile [PACKAGELISTFILE]
    file containing the list of packages to evaluate
  -i [ITEMS_REPORTED], --items_reported [ITEMS_REPORTED]  
                        number of items reported for NVD/CVE matches  
  -n [PACKAGE_NAME], --package_name [PACKAGE_NAME]  
    package name to search for  
  -o [OUTPUTFILE], --outputfile [OUTPUTFILE]  
    name of output file  
  -t [TYPE], --type [TYPE]  
    format of output, options are text, json or html 
  -u  update the toolswatch vfeed database  
  -v [PACKAGE_VERSION], --package_version [PACKAGE_VERSION]  
                        package version to look for  
  -V, --Version         report the version of falco and exit 

DEPENDENCIES
    falco uses the toolswatch/vfeed sqlite database.  To initialize the
    database or to update the database use:
    $ falco -u
    To setup the database for the required rich text queries you must do
    this too: 
    $ falco -c 

EXAMPLE
    Use falco to look for vulnerability for python 2.7.3 in NVD:  
    $ falco -d ./vfeed.db -n python -v 2.7.3  
    
    *** Potential security defect found in python:2.7.3  
    CVE: CVE-2014-9365  
    CVSS Score: 5.8  
    CPE id: cpe:/a:python:python:2.7.3  
    Published on: 2014-12-12T06:59:07.063-05:00  
    Summary Description: The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4) xmlrpclib libraries in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x before 3.4.3, when accessing an HTTPS URL, do not (a) check the certificate against a trust store or verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject s (b) Common Name or (c) subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.  

HINTS
    falco uses the toolswatch/vfeed database. The database is updated every week or two. Update this database in a cron job. with the -u followed by -c. 

    To regularly search for a group of libraries, apps and operating systems, put the information in a watchfile and run vfeed -f watchfile. The format of each watch item in the file is packagename:version .   

    If you are doing regular software builds, for example using make, you can use falco with the the -b option. If falco finds a match, it will return an error, the make will exit, and you will have to determine whether the bug reported has a security impact on your project and if you need to update to that newer package.  

  Getting aquinted with packagenames as used in NVD CVE
    falco is only as good as the package name and version information you give it. Start by just using falco -n to see if you are using the correct name. You can also search the vfeed.db database using the toolswatch vfeedcli or sqlite to see how you need to name your package name to be compatible with the CPE names used in the database. To examine the CPE dictionary look at:

BUGS
    Searching for package names and versions can lead to both false positives and false negatives. The CPE matching documentation specifies greater than and less than logic. falco and other tools use regex matches and the fact that the NVD data provides an intended comprehensive list of impacted versions for each CVE number.
