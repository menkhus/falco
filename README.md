Falco: 3rd party code security intelligence for software maintainers
==================================================

What is falco?
--------------
Falco is a simple tool to search the NIST NVD and report latent security bugs in 3rd party software packages in your projects. By placing falco in your build or QA process, you can be alerted when new security defects are reported.  You could make falco part of your architectural review process as you evaluate component choices.

Falco Dependencies
------------------
Falco depends on the vfeed.db, a sqlite implementation of the NIST NVD vulnerability database - vFeed/vFeedApi, the open source correlated & cross-linked local vulnerability database by NJ OUCHN, Toolswatch.org 
(copied from https://github.com/toolswatch/vFeed/) 

You must install and update the vfeed database and then point falco at the up-to-date database in order to have an effective vulnerability intelligence feature in your software workflow. Use this command to install and update the vfeed database:
$ falco -u
Use this command to update the database with the full text search tables used in falco:
$ falco -c 

Also use the same commands periodically. The vfeed database must be updated periodically in order to implement the notion that you are getting current threat knowledge.

Setup for first use from the falco directory:  

```bash
$ falco -u 
$ falco -c
```  

If you find falco useful, please give a shoutout to us, and the great folks who build and maintain toolswatch vfeed.

No free lunch
-------------
Users of falco are responsible for making sure the package names, and versions supplied to falco are current with the project being evaluated. There is no sophistication built into falco to survey your code for 3rd party dependencies.There are commercial products which can do this and so much more. Falco users must obtain and manage their own configuration management data for their project.

Recently, Jeremy Long, of OWASP dependency-check gave me a heads up regarding other FOSS projects that also provide 3rd party code dependency security checks. See the list below for some other 3rd party code dependency check apps.

Why falco
---------
We wrote the tool because (at the time we looked) there were no accessible tools for developers and project maintainers to easily find known security vulnerabilities in software they use as part of a project.  Falco is bare-bones simple, and implements a basic software security check mandated by many security maturity models such as the one in OWASP: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities, OpenSAMM - http://www.opensamm.org/, or BSIMM - http://www.bsimm.com/online/governance/cp/ 

Falco is not a code scanner
---------------------------
Falco does not test the software, it simply looks to see that the package and version you tell it are in a vulnerability database.  If a package and version are in the vulnerability database, you could have a vulnerability in software you depend upon. You need to respond to by validating that vulnerability assertion, and then update the package as needed.  Other ways to discover known exiting vulnerabilities are through code scanning tools (mentioned above) network security scanners like OpenVAS or Nessus  (often used by commercial customers) and using code analysis tools like HP Fortify or Coverity.

Do 3rd party code threat intelligence
-------------------------------------
If you are developing a security lifecycle for your project, then managing 3rd party code security bugs is just a small part of a very baseline behavior. We wish you luck and hope that falco helps in your journey.

Usage Examples
-----------------------
Assumes vfeed.db is in the same directory as falco  

### Example 1, check a package named 'python' version '2.7.3' for vulnerabilities in the NVD database ###

```sh
$ ./falco.py -n python -v 2.7.3
```    
One Item being checked  
        *** Potential security defect found in python:2.7.3  
CVE: CVE-2013-7040  
CVSS Score: 4.3  
CPE id: cpe:/a:python:python:2.7.3  
Published on:             2014-05-19T10:55:09.987-04:00  
Summary Description: Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1150.  
  
### Example 2, using falco in build situations ###

Assume the feed database is in the vfeed subdirectory. Check a package named 'python' version '2.7.3' for vulnerabilities in the NVD database and if any are found, return a non zero return value.  Placing this in a makefile will cause make to exit when a vulnerability matches.  

```bash
$ ./falco.py -d ./vfeed/vfeed.db -b -n python -v 2.7.3 -o falcolog  
$ echo $?  
1  
$  
```  

### Example 3, falco in a makefile, using the -b (break the build) flag ###

#### Makefile: ####
\# this will FAIL make because this version 1.14.7 bash is found in the NVD  
\# database.  
\# Solution is twofold: to update bash to most recent code, and  
\# to change the # make entry to reflect that new version number:  
bash.build.out:  
    ./falco.py -b -n bash  -v 1.14.7 -d ./vfeed/vfeed.db > bash.build.out  
clean:  
    rm bash.build.out  
  
#### Execution ####

```bash
$ make  
./falco.py -b -n bash  -v 1.14.7 -d ./vfeed.db -o bash.build.out  
make: *** [bash.build.out] Error 1  
```  
#### Explanation ####
 -b cause falco to return fail if any there are CVE findings returned from searching NVD for the package and version.
  
#### Suggested action ####
File a bug in the bug tracker, change the makefile, remove -b, and when the bug is fixed, update the makefile again to reflect the latest package number and reinstate the -b   
  
Dependencies
------------
Falco uses the NVD database from the vfeed project:   https://github.com/toolswatch/vFeed  
Download the vfeed package and use the configure feature to gather the nvd database in sqlite3 form. Setup for first use from the falco directory:  

```bash
$ bin/get_vfeed.sh
$ falco -u 
$ falco -c
```  

2) Write down where you put the vfeed.db file, and store that for future use, falco uses that database as an argument.   
3) Note it would be a good idea to put this "falco -u;falco -c" in a cron job, since falco counts on using updated NVD data to see when new vulnerabilities exist. This database is updated every few weeks.
