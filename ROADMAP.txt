    Roadmap for falco changes
    =========================

0.6.8 - testing, create a new set of tests, make sure that most 
recent versions of cpe ids are reported, not based on CVSS, or Date,
but the most important thing is latest version of vulnerable softwara,
then CVSS, then date

where i left off:
    worked on sorting cpeids inline.  remove that code, DRY, create a function or class for cpeid that sorts the list, trims it to start with the CPE id provided and returns that trimmed list.

    the cpeid database needs to have a cve as primary key

    create tests for all the features

    
0.6.9 - put a loader in, so that for a given project (apple for example)
they have all their data in the database. Be able to run a client report at will with database as input.

0.6.10 - store findings for a project in the database, so that you are 
not beholding to reports stashed. client is keyname for the project. project subkey is product, and sub to that is the product version, versions

0.6.11 - generate a report in CSV form, so that clients can manage the output

0.6.12 - record clients security bulletins in database, so that they can 
be rationalized against the report. Question answered - does this bulletin answer this reported CVE defect? Use this in reporting.

0.6.13 - record validation in database, so that we have a working artifact against the results.  Answer, does this validation substantiate the CVE finding or invalidate it?  Use this in reporting.

0.6.14 - merge reporting so that you have initial finding, security bulletin check, validation of versioni, & etc in database. Make reporting report only validated findings.  Share the report of findings, why they are invalid as well as the table of valid concerns.

0.6.15 - create a tools database with documentation, so that all artifacts for client are stored in the database.  How is this not a git repository? Can a repo in tar form be stored in the DB.  Does the repo represent a historical record of that tools developement?

0.6.16 - create a case management interface so that findings needinf management can be submitted to the roundup case tracker
